#  XOR_Neural _net
 A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy to learn the XOR logic gate. It features manual forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. The network consists of an input layer, one hidden layer with sigmoid activation, and an output layer. Trains on XOR data to learn non-linear patterns.
